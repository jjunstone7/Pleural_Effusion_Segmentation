# Pleural_Effusion_Segmentation

## Project Outline
Pleural_Effusion_Seg is a baseline code for segmenting pleural effusion. The process involves converting 3D images into 2D slices along the axial plane for segmentation. Currently, the project is in its initial stages, but I plan to continuously develop and enhance this technology.
